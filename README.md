# Recursive-Power-of-2

Given an integer n, return True if n is a power of two. Otherwise, return `False``.

An integer n is a power of two if there exists an integer x such that n == 2Ë£.

Solve the problem recursively. What is the time complexity of this function? What is the space complexity?

def is_power_of_two(n):
	pass

Example Usage:

# print(is_power_of_two(1))    # Output: True (2^0)
# print(is_power_of_two(2))    # Output: True (2^1)
# print(is_power_of_two(16))   # Output: True (2^4)
# print(is_power_of_two(3))    # Output: False
# print(is_power_of_two(0))    # Output: False
# print(is_power_of_two(-16))  # Output: False
